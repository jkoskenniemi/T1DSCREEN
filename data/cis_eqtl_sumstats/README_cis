Additional information
----------------------
These files contain all cis-eQTL results from eQTLGen, accompanying the article.
19,250 genes that showed expression in blood were tested.
Every SNP-gene combination with a distance <1Mb from the center of the gene and  tested in at least 2 cohorts was included.
Associations where SNP/proxy positioned in Illumina probe were not removed from combined analysis.



UPDATE LOG
----------

2018-10-19: Initial data release

2018-12-19: In the current README, following file names have been fixed and updated:

2019-12-20: Cis-eQTLs are now updated to have a 2-cohort filter: every cis-eQTL must be tested in at least 2 cohorts to be reported
