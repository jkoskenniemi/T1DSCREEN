Additional information
----------------------
This file contains all cis-eQTL results from eQTLGen, accompanying the article.
19,250 genes that showed expression in blood and were on autosomal chromosomes were tested.
Every SNP-gene combination with a distance <1Mb and tested in at least 2 cohorts was included.
The files were formatted for use with the SMR (summary based Mendelian Randomization) software (Zhu et al., 2016, Nature Genetics; http://cnsgenomics.com/software/smr/)

Calculations
------------
The minor allele frequencies were calculated using reported allele counts from all cohorts except Framingham Heart Study, because the relatedness in this cohort may influence allele frequencies.
Beta and standard error values were calculated as follows:
beta = Z-score / sqrt(2 * alleleFreq * (1-alleleFreq) * (N + Z-score^2)
se = 1 / sqrt(2 * alleleFreq * (1-alleleFreq) * (N + Z-score^2)

Where N = sample size (max. 31864)

NOTE: in the eQTLGen manuscript we have used 1kG 1pv3 ALL reference panel for calculating minor allele frequencies instead of empirical allele frequencies inferred from eQTLGen.


Updates
-------
2019-12-12
We have updated the SMR formatted files.
The previous version:
- included only significant eQTLs (FDR < 0.05)
- used N = 31864 for all effects
- used cis-eQTLs calculated with an older version of the eQTL pipeline
- included cis-eQTLs identified in 1 cohort

The new version:
- includes all cis-eQTLs (no FDR threshold)
- uses the N calculated per effect
- is based on the latest version of the pipeline (BinaryMetaAnalyzer-1.0.17-SNAPSHOT.jar)
- includes cis-eQTLs only if they are tested in more than 1 cohort
