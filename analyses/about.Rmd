Type 1 diabetes is one of the most common chronic childhood 
diseases and 
requires daily monitoring of blood glucose and insulin 
substitution. Failure to manage T1D increases the risk of 
hypoglycemia and complications of hyperglycemia, such as 
coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, 
cerebrovascular disease, nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, 
and blindness. Therefore, the development of a disease-modifying 
therapy that would prevent type 1 diabetes represents a clear 
medical unmet need. 

Discovery and validation of prognostic biomarkers of type 1 
diabetes, such as presence of multiple autoantibodies against 
beta cell derived peptides and mild glycemia in an oral glucose-
tolerance test, have facilitated clinical trials to prevent type 
1 diabetes during the asymptomatic phase when the beta-cell 
function is not yet lost. However, they have generally struggled 
to meet their recruitment goals, because of the limited access 
to autoantibody positive subjects and the fact that asymptomatic 
children at risk for type 1 diabetes are often quite  
reluctant to participate in intensive follow-up.

Although Teplizumab, a monoclonal antibody against CD3, received an 
indication for prevention of type 1 diabetes by Food and Drug 
Administration in the USA in November 2022 under emergency 
breakthrough designation, the vast majority of 
prevention trials of type 1 diabetes have provided discouraging 
results. Unfortunately, type 1 diabetes seems to be a heterogenous 
disease that is poorly represented by the current animal models. 

Recently, genetic evidence has been successfully used in target 
validation for various diseases. Candidate drugs that are backed 
by genetic evidence are twice as likely to be approved for clinical 
use than those that are not. For instance, genetic evidence led 
to clinical trials which found evidence for the use of ustekinumab, 
a monoclonal antibody against IL-23, for treatment of Crohnâ€™s 
disease. Furthermore, techniques of genetics-informed causal 
inference, such as Mendelian randomization and colocalization,
can provide an estimate of efficacy and safety of a potential drug. 

These techniques present an interesting opportunity to overcome
the problems of the limited sample size and heterogeneity. 
In this project, we aim to evaluate genetic evidence of efficacy
and safety of seven drugs that already have a market approval. 
We believe that this information can be used to evaluate the 
potential of these drugs for prevention of type 1 diabetes.
